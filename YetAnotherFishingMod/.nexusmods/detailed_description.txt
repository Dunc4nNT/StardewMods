[size=5][b]How to Use[/b][/size]

Once you've configured the mod the way you want, simply equip a fishing rod and start fishing!

[size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]

This mod is made for [b]Stardew Valley 1.6[/b] using [b]SMAPI 4.0[/b]. This mod will [b]not[/b] work on versions prior to those mentioned.

Both [b]singleplayer[/b] and [b]multiplayer[/b] should work. If you are having issues with multiplayer, make sure you've downloaded at least version 1.0.1 of the mod as this included a multiplayer hotfix.

I have yet to test [b]split screen[/b], but did try to make it compatible.

This mod does not change fish spawns, so it [i]should[/i] work with mods adding [b]custom fish[/b].

*Should* be compatible with mods that add [b]custom bait and or hooks[/b], I've yet to test this, but as long as the category for the custom item was set correctly, this mod should detect them.

This mod will [b]not[/b] work with [b]custom enchantments[/b] at the moment. I'm looking to add support for this in the future.

Likely to conflict with mods that try to do the same thing. Due to every option in this mod being configurable it should not be likely to cause issues, as you can simply turn the conflicting option off. Though, feel free to report any mods that do conflict by opening an [url=https://github.com/Dunc4nNT/StardewMods/issues]issue[/url], updating the README and [url=https://github.com/Dunc4nNT/StardewMods/pulls]sending a pull request[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20391?tab=posts]comment on the NexusMods page[/url].

[size=5][b]To Do[/b][/size]

List of things I'd like to add at some point. I'm uncertain how many of these I'll actually end up doing. List in no specific order.

[list]
[*][s]Look into potential bug with the new bait (not catching 3 fish)[/s] fixed in next release
[*][s]Set InstantCatchTreasure to true by default[/s] fixed in next release
[*]Look into difficulty value changing XP gained
[*]Rewrite attachment/enchantment logic
[*]Allow for custom enchantments
[*]Remove the "do add bait/tackle/enchantment" option and simply have a "None" option in the dropdown menu
[*]Allow 2 tackle slots (as per 1.6 content update)
[*]Allow users to set the amount of fish to catch (so allow a custom amount to be entered), make sure this works well with bait items so ideally have a "vanilla" option
[*]Have a percentage slider for the "always perfect" setting (as well as allowing vanilla settings)
[*]Have a percentage slider for the "catch treasure" setting (as well as allowing vanilla settings)
[*]Set instantly catch treasure to true by default
[*]Refund stamina on max cast option
[*]Skip treasure opening animation
[*]Reorganise GMCM options as some are vaguely worded and it's unclear what they do. Also possibly difficult to navigate once i add some of the above options as well
[*]Make sliders increment by values of say 0.05 so it's possible to set it back to 1.0 and not 1.00000001
[*]Look into an auto cast/recast option, configurable keybind for it as well
[*]Gradually learn catching fish, so say after catching 5 of a certain fish the amount of time it takes to catch the next one decreases, all the way till it's instant.
[*]Dutch translations
[*]Skip fish catch animation
[*]Automatically loot caught fish and trash
