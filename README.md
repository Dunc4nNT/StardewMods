## Translations

English is the only language fully supported by me, and guaranteed to be up to date.

There are various languages that have translations available to download and use on NexusMods. Do note that these may not always be up to date, as I can't guarantee support for those languages myself.

If the language you'd like to see has no translation, or it's outdated, feel free to create your own translations and publish them as a mod translation on NexusMods. **Please only upload the translation file and nothing else.** You can either upload it inside of a `ModName/i18n/` folder or as just the file. For extra information, take a look at the [translation wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations).

Due to me not being able to guarantee whether other languages are up to date, I prefer they be uploaded separately from this mod (so a mod translation on NexusMods). For players this means you'll have to look at the "Translations" tab on Nexus and check if the language you speak is on there. For translators this means you'll have to publish your translations on Nexus and publish updates after new releases yourself.

If you have a question regarding translations (whether it's about how to translate, how to upload them etc), feel free to contact me any way.

## Contact

**In almost all cases** please leave a comment on the respective NexusMods comments page detailing your issue. **Always** include a link to your [SMAPI log][https://smapi.io/log]. **Without** this log it may be impossible for me to solve the problem you're having. If you prefer, you could send a DM on Nexus.

**Only after receiving permission**, may you try contacting me through Discord DMs or the SDV server (never.toxic). I likely won't respond otherwise.
