## Frameworks (for Mod Author)

If you're using one of my framework mods, and you need help, you can either open a comment on the NexusMods page,
send me a message on [NexusMods][nexusmods], or send me a discord message (`never.toxic`) as it's likely to be a
longer back and forth. Please include your [SMAPI log][smapi-log], your [code][smapi-json], and your 
[manifest][smapi-json]. Describe, in detail, what you are trying to achieve.
